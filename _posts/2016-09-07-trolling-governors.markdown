Quick update to note that I've been writing and performing elsewhere, check it out:

[In August I wrote a first hand account of trolling Maine Governor Paul LePage for Vice.](http://www.vice.com/read/paul-lepage-troll-phone-call-meltdown-maine)

[And in May a story of mine was featured on Kevin Allison's RISK! podcast](http://risk-show.com/podcast/stumbling-blocks/)

I'm very proud of both of these! plz read and listen and laugh!!!
