Hamas has launched a new website, <a href="http://www.palutube.com">www.palutube.com</a>, to highlight pro-Palestine videos from the war in Gaza and assorted other pro-Palestinian content including nationalist songs and spirited demonstrations. This is in response to Israel's <a href="http://wearecyborgs.net/blog/2008/12/30/idf-video-blogs-attacks-in-gaza/">already strong</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/israelconsulate">Web 2.0 presence</a> covering the war. Palutube is in Arabic by default but a drop down menu on the right side allows you to switch to English. Currently I am having a great deal of trouble loading the site so don't be surprised if you have trouble as well.  Nonetheless I will try to embed a video from Palutube below. It is worth noting that because Hamas has chosen to  host their own website (though not host all of their own videos), they are not bound by any other web portal's terms of service (like the IDF is bound to YouTube's TOS and authority). Thus there is some powerful and controversial language on Palutube. Most notably a banner that reads "The Zionist Holocaust in Gaza of the Innocent People [sic]".

We are now talking about a war in which Israel <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/30/israel-gaza-journalists">refuses to allow foreign journalists access into Gaza</a>, and both sides are battling for global support and to shape the narrative of the conflict via Web 2.0 strategies. As the Gulf War was the first cable news war, the current Israel-Palestine conflict is the first YouTube war. The obvious question being: is this the future of wartime journalistic propaganda?

It is clear from watching just <a href="http://www.palutube.com/video/96/HAMAS-AND-GAZA-SONG-%D9%86%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A3%D8%B3">a few</a> of <a href="http://www.palutube.com/video/53/مسيرة-نظمتها-الحركة-الاسلامية-بالقدس-للتضامن-مع-غزة">the videos</a> <a href=http://www.palutube.com/video/49/%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AE%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%86">available on Palutube</a> that there is a different tone here than on the IDF's YouTube channel. The IDF's content has focused on justifying their attacks, which have been widely criticized as a disproportionate response to Hamas' aggression, through videos of Hamas' rocket attacks and evidence of other Hamas wrongdoing. In contrast the new Hamas site is a mix of videos that either display the large scale suffering that is going on in Gaza or provide evidence that Palestinian morale in Gaza is not dead through songs and videos of demonstrations. 

The latter videos are particularly of interest considering the character of the Israeli attacks. It is quite clear that Israel's attacks are an act of aggression by the side with the upper hand. Hamas rocket fire into Israel, while indefensible from the perspective of someone who would like to see the conflict resolved through diplomacy, is essentially impotent in comparison to the Israeli response. The Israeli message is that Hamas is thoroughly out gunned and by continuing to fire into Israel Hamas is inviting Israel to respond tenfold simply because they can. In a recent New York Times Op-Ed piece <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/opinion/08khalidi.html?_r=1">Rashid Khalidi presented a particularly insightful quote</a> from former IDF chief of staff Moshe Yaalon: “The Palestinians must be made to understand in the deepest recesses of their consciousness that they are a defeated people.” Temporarily setting aside how disturbing that statement is, with Palutube Hamas appears intent on saying it is also not correct.
