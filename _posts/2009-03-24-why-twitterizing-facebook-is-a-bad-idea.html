Recently in Slate Farhad Manjoo argued that despite the initial outcry we will <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2214447/">eventually adjust to the new Facebook</a> layout. While I wholeheartedly agree with the underlying observations that we are shy to accept changes in things we are very familiar with and that we quickly adjust, I also think Facebook has erred.

Facebook is clearly aping Twitter, the microblogging social media platform that has seen major growth in the last few months. Recent Twitter converts range from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kinchknifeblade">myself</a> to <a href="http://twitter.com/JohnMcCain">Senator John McCain</a> to <a href="http://twitter.com/the_real_shaq">Shaq</a>. But I wonder if by moving too far towards Twitter's layout Facebook is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. 

Facebook's strength was social interaction but now if you go to the Facebook profile of anyone who is actually using Facebook as a microblogging platform you see less of that social interaction. I have my Facebook status updates linked to Twitter and several of my friends do the same. Before the switch if you had gone to one of our Facebook profiles you would have seen a couple of our most recent status updates and after that Facebook's newsfeed algorithm would cut off status updates to include things like wall posts and tagged images. Now Facebook's primary newsfeed criteria is recentness. So if you update your status a lot (or Tweet a lot, if your Facebook status is linked to Twitter) on your wall is a slew of your last status updates and not a lot of the digitized social interaction people actually surf to Facebook for. 

As I said, I believe the strength of Facebook is that it's an interactive rolodex and people want the interactions between friends to be the focal point. If microblogging becomes the focal point it is a completely different beast. And I anticipate as Facebook tweaks their new design we will see changes made so that Facebook walls are more like old Facebook walls and less like out of place Twitter feeds.
