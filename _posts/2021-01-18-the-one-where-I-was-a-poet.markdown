My friend [Jemima Foxtrot](http://jemimafoxtrot.com/) is a brilliant poet and I did a workshop with her on writing happiness where I wrote this poem I ended up liking a lot.

## Fish Tacos

Imagine making the error<br/>
Of putting up on the cross<br/>
To die<br/>
Three delicious fish tacos<br/>
Tilapia slathered in salsa verde<br/>

Holy guacamole<br/>
Not Jesus per se but<br/>
How ridiculous, just eat the damn things<br/>
Let the salty joy be with you<br/>

A bit of onion<br/>
Pico de gallo<br/>
Tickle my palette<br/>
Sour cream?<br/>
It speaks out "only in your dream"<br/>

A bit of spice would be so nice<br/>
Take me to your grill<br/>
More sodium chloride<br/>
Take me on a ride<br/>

Do me a favor<br/>
A tinge of smokey flavor<br/>
Maillard reaction<br/>
The dopest action<br/>

Heat up a corn tortilla<br/>
Everyone wants to be ya<br/>
Fish tacos<br/>
Who wouldn't want those?<br/>
