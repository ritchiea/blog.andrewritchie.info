After all my posts on the Israel-Palestine conflict it is nice to get a reminder that YouTube is more than just a instrument of war (it's weird to be able to write that). According to Reuters, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSTRE50G1JN20090117">the Vatican is opening a YouTube channel</a> to show Pope and church events.
