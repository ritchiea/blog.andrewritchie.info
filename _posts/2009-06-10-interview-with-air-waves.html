You should read my <a href="http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/archives/2009/06/freewilliamsbur_1.html">chat with Nicole Schneit</a> of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/airwavesmusic">Air Waves</a>. And of course listen to their music. Air Waves is Dan Deacon's favorite band and Dan Deacon makes great music that sounds like if someone took away the London Philharmonic's instruments, drugged them up on dexadrine and forced them to make music with casios (although Air Waves sounds way more like Neil Young than Spiderman of the Rings).
