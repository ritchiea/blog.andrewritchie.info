When I think about companies and organizations I like, I tend to think of them on the same side (does this imply thinking about the world as having a central antagonism?). What I mean by that is, Apple creates ground breaking products I like and the Electronics Frontier Foundation is an organization that does political and legal work I support so I intuitively think of them both as being on the "good" side of the technology world (the bad side being represented by Comcast, the RIAA, etc.). Like all oversimplifications, that view quickly becomes useless because organizations on the "good" side sometimes have serious conflicts. Apple used to donate money to the EFF, at least until Apple decided to sue a blogger for trying to leak information pre-MacWorld. In turn the EFF sued Apple to protect that blogger's first amendment rights. Apple was shocked that an organization they donate money to was suing them. Apple no longer donates to the EFF.
