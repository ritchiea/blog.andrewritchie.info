The IDF has released two new YouTube videos that are sure to add new sparks to a number of already contentious debates. In the video below IDF Captain Benjamin Rutland explains the IDF's motivation behind controversial mortar fire on a UN school in Gaza.

Another video cited by Captain Rutland <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmXXUOs27lI">shows the alleged Hamas rocket fire</a> from the UN school. Israel is correct that by housing their forces in a UN school Hamas is in violation of international law however Israel's attacks on Gaza are also in violation of international law. Due to the density of the population in Gaza Israel's attacks are in violation of Geneva Conventions. And here we violate international law to punish those who see it fit to violate international law...

UPDATE: The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/middleeastCrisis/idUSL7122987">UN has issued a statement</a> denying there were any Hamas militants in the attacked school.
